# ValorPay React [DEMO LINK HERE](https://valorpay.netlify.app/)

Passage.js is a JavaScript library for Merchants to collect sensitive payment data from the users and send directly to Valor. Merchants can integrate the script and customize the checkout form as per their requirements. The authentication is done by a Client Token generated by GetClientToken API, which is discussed in the later section.

## Integrating The Script

After getting the token, integrate the Passage.js Script in your checkout page where you want to process the card details and payments. Pass the received token in the script with **data-clientToken** attribute.

You can integrate it using following script:

```
<script src="https://js.valorpaytech.com/V1/js/Passage.min.js" data-name="valor_passage" data-clientToken="YOUR TOKEN" data-epi="YOUR EPI"></script>

```
